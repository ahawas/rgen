#rgen

This is a number of small class intended to help with random number generation. Feel free to use them at your own will.

1. UniformSimulator
	This simulates the Uniform distribution numbers (0,1), that are used by other classes.
2. ExponentialSimulator
	This simulates the Exponential distribution, given lambda. e.simulate(n, lambda) to use.
3. NormalSimulator
	This simulates the Normal distribution, given mu and sigma(mean and standard deviation).
